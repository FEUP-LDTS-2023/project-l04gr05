## HOW TO PLAY

The objective of our game is to defeat the enemy army, capture bases and control facilities to obtain coins and additional units. After moving a unit depending of your surroundings you can either capture nearby facilities or attack nearby enemy units.

The different types of facilities that exist are:

 - Factories - where you can buy Ground Units 
 - Airports - where you can buy Air Units

 - "ESC" key - opens the menu or goes back to the default section, 
 - "ENTER" key  - confirms the action you want to make
